# soundcast

soundcast is an application that allows mobile devices to send their music to a host device so that everyone can listen to the same music from a single device.

Perfect for a group of buddies on the road who all want to listen to their own music on the car's speakers when only one phone can connect to the stereo.
Great for parties, also.

## Getting Started
Unless the team objects, we will be using mainly GitHub and Android Studio to manage the project. [Here](https://github.com/cs146group4/CourtCounterCopy/blob/master/README.md) is a good guide on getting started with both of these things, written up by fellow user [mdemong](https://github.com/mdemong) on his group's project page. Using GitHub requires [making an account,](https://github.com/join) but I feel like it'll be useful to have an account in our line of work anyway.
